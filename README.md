# Image Enhacement Resnet

This repository contains the implementation and evaluation of different convolutional neural network architectures for various image enhancement tasks. Below is an overview of the contents of each folder:

/AE_ResNet: contains the python implementation of the two ResNetAE proposed. The file resnetAE.py contains the python class corresponding to the ResNetAE, meanwhile the python file resnetAE_mod.py contains the implementation of the ResNetAE_skip.

/AE_VGG: contains the python implementation of the VGGAE.

/denoising_color: contains the jupyter notebooks for the training of the model for the denoising task in RGB images and the evaluation results.

/denoising_mnsit: contains the jupyter notebooks for the training of the model for the denoising task for the MNIST dateset and the evaluation results.

/image colorization: contains the jupyter notebooks for the training of the model for the colorization task and the evaluation results.

/superresolution: contains the jupyter notebooks for the training of the model for the super-resolution task  and the evaluation results.
